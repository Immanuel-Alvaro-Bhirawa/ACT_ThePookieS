# Problem Statement 1: Education
- Education is conducted in a centralised manner (Universities), with current decentralised options (Private tutoring services as well as online courses) being not as good an option as traditional education in terms of recognition.
- Firstly, education is ineffective where it takes 3-4 years for an individual to be properly trained for the workforce, often times even leading to a skills mismatch at times.
- Secondly, institutions like Universities often act as a middleman connecting students to potential employers, which may lead to inefficiencies and miscommunication
- Thirdly, education led by research institutions (ie. Universities) might be unaware of industry needs and are more concerned with academic research and developments.
- Fourthly, with the impending notion of lifelong learning being essential in the future, current education is not only expensive but also slower to adapt to trends and developments around us due to their primary role as a research institution
- Lastly, Higher Education institutions are often slow to adapt due to centralised management structure, if education was carried out in a decentralised manner, education can be more efficient.
# Problem Statement 2: Hiring
- Is predominantly done via a few headhunters and the majority of candidates going through a screening process. The problem is that this is a system of hiring that leads to a mismatch of skillsets between potential candidates and employers.
- Firstly, applicants may not be completely aware of their suitability to the role that they are applying for
- Secondly, applicants may not be aware of other opportunities that exist that they may be suitable for
- Thirdly, hirers have a limited pool of applicants that they base their hiring decisions on
- Lastly, although a networking careers platforms like LinkedIn is crucial, it may drive people away by creating imposter syndromm and also has functions that can be edited and changed according to the user which creates a falsifying image.
